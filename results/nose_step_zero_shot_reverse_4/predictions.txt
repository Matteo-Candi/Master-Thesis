The Python equivalent of the Java code is as follows:

    while n != 0:
        sum += n % 10
        n = n // 10

```

This Python function takes an integer as input and calculates the sum of its digits. It uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the input number by 10 until it becomes zero, adding each digit to the sum. The function then returns the sum of the digits.

Note: The function assumes that the input number is an integer. If the input number is not an integer, it will not be processed correctly.

            countOne += 1
        n = n / b
    return countOne >= 3 and countOne == length
```

This Python function takes two parameters: n and b. It calculates the remainder of n divided by b and counts the number of ones in the resulting remainder. If the remainder is 1, it increments the countOne variable. The function then returns whether the countOne is greater than or equal to 3 and equal to the length.

    return new String(s1)
```

This Python function takes a string as input and converts it into an array of characters. It then loops through each character in the string and checks if it's greater than or equal to '5'. If it's greater than or equal to '5', it subtracts '9' from it and converts it back to a string. If the first character of the string is '0', it sets it to '9'. Finally, it returns the new string.

Please note that Python does not have a built-in function to convert a string into an array of characters, so we need to manually convert it.

```python
def minInt(s):
    s1 = s.toCharArray()
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if s1[i] >= '5':
            s1[i] = (char)(('9' - s1[i] + '0'))

This Python function will return the quotient of the division operation. The function takes two parameters, dividend and divisor, and returns the quotient. The function uses a loop to calculate the quotient. The loop starts from 31 and decrements it down to 0. If the dividend is less than the divisor, the loop will add the divisor to the temp variable and then calculate the quotient. If the sign is -1, the quotient is negative. Otherwise, the quotient is positive. The function then returns the quotient.

The Python equivalent of the Java code is as follows:

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for ch in s.toCharArray():
        if vowels.indexOf(ch) != -1:
            count += 1
    if s.charAt(s.length() - 1) == 'y' or s.charAt(s.length() - 1) == 'Y':
        count += 1
    return count
```

This Python function takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels in the string. It uses the `indexOf` method to find the position of a vowel in the string and increments the count if the vowel is found. Finally, it returns the count.

def check(v, a, m):
    tec = 0
    b = [0]*(len(a)+3)
    for i in range(len(a)):
        tec -= b[i]
        if a[i] + tec < v:
            mov = v - a[i] - tec
            ans += mov
            b[i+2] = mov
    return ans <= m
```

This Python function will return a boolean value based on whether the sum of the elements in the list 'a' is less than or equal to 'v'. It will also set the value of 'ans' to the sum of 'a' and 'mov' to the difference between 'v' and 'a'. The function will return 'ans' less than or equal to 'm'.

This Python function takes an integer n as input and returns a string representation of the number. It uses a list instead of a StringBuilder object to store the digits of the number, and then calculates the sum of the digits, and finally returns the string representation of the number. The sum is divided by 2 until it reaches zero, and then it returns the string representation of the number.

Please note that Python does not have a built-in StringBuilder class, so we need to use a list instead.

```python
def solve(n):
    biStr = []
    sum = 0
    for c in str(n):
        sum += int(c) - 0
    while sum > 0:
        biStr.append(sum % 2)
        sum /= 2
    return ''.join(biStr)

This Python function takes a list of strings, a string, and an integer n. It creates a hashmap, then iterates over n times, putting each string in the hashmap. If the hashmap contains the string s, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the score by adding the ASCII value of each character in the string s. The score is then returned.

def findLongestSub(bin):
    n = len(bin)
    prevSum = {}
    maxLen = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if bin[i] == '1':

```

This Python function will return the maximum length of a binary string. It uses a HashMap to keep track of the sum of '1's and '0's, and then returns the maximum length of the binary string. The HashMap is used to store the sum of '1's and '0's, and then the maximum length of the binary string is returned.

The Python equivalent of the Java code is as follows:

```python
def compare_odd_even_range(numbers):
    odd_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 1]
    even_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
    if odd_numbers < even_numbers:
        return -1
    elif odd_numbers > even_numbers:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

This Python function takes a list of numbers and filters out odd and even numbers, then compares the two lists and returns -1 if the odd numbers list is smaller than the even numbers list, else returns 1 if the odd numbers list is larger than the even numbers list. Finally, it returns 0 if neither list is smaller than the other.

This Python function is equivalent to the Java code.

Note: Python does not support Java's stream API, so we have to use list comprehension instead.
