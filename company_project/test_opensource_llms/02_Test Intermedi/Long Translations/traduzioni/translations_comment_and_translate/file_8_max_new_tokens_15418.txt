SAS is a data analytics language that is often used for statistics, data analysis, and business intelligence. Python, on the other hand, is a popular data science and machine learning language that is widely used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and artificial intelligence.

It seems that you have not provided the SAS code that you want to translate to Python. Please provide the SAS code and I will try my best to help you translate it to Python.
