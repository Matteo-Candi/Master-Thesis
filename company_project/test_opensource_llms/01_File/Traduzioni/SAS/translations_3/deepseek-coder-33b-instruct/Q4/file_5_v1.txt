In Python, you typically use libraries like pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations. However, in order to run this SAS script on a local machine or server without any additional setup, we would need some sort of environment emulator such as Jupyter notebooks or something similar that can interpret SAS code.

Please let me know if you are looking for assistance with translating this code from SAS to Python using pandas and NumPy or other libraries in an actual Python environment.
