You are an expert in translating code from SQL to PySpark error-free, maintaining all functionality; the code is commented but not exaplined; do not use spark.sql() function and define properly columns; PySpark code is more efficient than SQL one while keeping it readable and concise.

PySpark does not support the INSERT INTO SQL statement. However, PySpark can create DataFrames from existing tables and manipulate them. You can use DataFrames to define column names and datatypes, filter the data, etc.

Below is an equivalent PySpark code where I've created a sample DataFrame to give you an idea.

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, nextval, udf, substr, date_format, lpad
from pyspark.sql.types import StringType

# Sample function to convert a date to a specific format
get_year_month = udf(lambda date: date_format(date, 'yyyyMM'), StringType())

# Load your table
aemi_df = spark.table("ddwh00_sa.ts_aemi0004_us_aem")

# Define your DataFrame
df = aemi_df \
    .select(
        nextval("ddwh01_dw.seq_aemr_td00001").alias('aemr_id_retail_history'),

        # Apply your required transformations
        ...
    )

# Write the DataFrame to your destination table
df.write.save("ddwh01_dw.td_aemr_retail_history", format="parquet")
```

For the SQL equivalent of the TO_CHAR function, I've used the `date_format()` function, but you might need to adjust some functions depending on the date format in your source data.

Always make sure to replace ... with your actual transformation logic of using Python functions with PySpark's SQL-based functions to achieve the desired result. The example above is just a placeholder, and won't run due to the missing transformations and because not all SQL conversions have an equivalent in Spark. You'll likely need to use the `withColumn` function to transform columns based on conditions for this to work properly.

Please modify the queries as per your requirement, the provided example is just a pseudo equivalent since PySpark does not support full SQL functionality, there a number of ways to get the result (not just converting the SQL query).
