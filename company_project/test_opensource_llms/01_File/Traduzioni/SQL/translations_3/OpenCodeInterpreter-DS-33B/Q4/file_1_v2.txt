Translating SQL to PySpark would require a lot of specific context about the table schema and other variables used in the code. However, I can provide an example on how it might be translated for your understanding. Here's a simple interpretation (it's not possible to fully translate it due to PySpark's limitations):

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Assuming 'ddwh01_dw' and 'ddwh00_sa' are your databases, replace with actual database names in your environment
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName('merge-example') \
    .getOrCreate()

df_target = spark.table("ddwh01_dw.TM_VENL_MASTER_LINK")

# Assuming the source data is in parquet format, replace with your actual data source
source_data = spark.read.parquet("your_path_here")

df_minus_target = source_data \
    .select(F.col('CLIENT').alias('VENL_CD_CLIENT'), 
            F.col('PARTNER_GUID').alias('VENL_CD_PARTNER_GUID'),
            F.col('VENDOR').alias('VENL_CD_VENDOR'),
            F.col('CRUSER').alias('VENL_CD_USER'),
            F.col('CRDAT').cast("date").alias('VENL_DT_DATE'),
            F.col('CRTIM').cast("timestamp").alias('VENL_DT_TIME')) \
    .subtract(df_target.selectExpr("VENL_CD_CLIENT", 
                                           "VENL_CD_PARTNER_GUID", 
                                           "VENL_CD_VENDOR",
                                           "VENL_CD_USER", 
                                           "VENL_DT_DATE",
                                           "VENL_DT_TIME"))

window = Window.partitionBy().orderBy(F.lit('190-01-01')) # Assuming a valid start validity date, replace with actual
df_final = df_minus_target \
    .withColumn("VENL_ID_LINK", F.monotonically_increasing_id()) \
    .withColumn("VENL_DT_START_VALIDITY", window) \
    .withColumn("VENL_DT_END_VALIDITY", F.lit('999-12-31')) # Assuming a valid end validity date, replace with actual
```
This PySpark code does not exactly mimic the SQL code given as it was mentioned earlier that there are too many specifics in the SQL code for the translation to be 10% accurate. There are also limitations such as PySpark's lack of MERGE INTO statement and PySpark does not directly support NVL function unlike SQL, which makes direct conversion impractical. This is why I've used subtraction operator (-) for illustration purposes only, and you would need to replace it with actual logic according to your application context.
