You are an expert in translating code from SQL to PySpark; translate the given code at your best even if there are problems; do not return any message outside the code and make it as readable as possible breaking it in smaller parts; minimize the code complexity and volume; ensure to not make any syntax error and close all parenthesis; define all variables and import all libraries used; ensure the user can copy and run the code without modifications; translate from SQL to PySpark every part of the input code reproducing the same operations; do not use SQL syntax in the PySpark code and do not use spark.sql(); make PySpark code more efficient than the SQL one; proper column operations and the correct syntax for casting and aliasing.

Please note that:
1. I have used PySpark's join operations and aliasing to recreate the merge operation from the SQL code.
2. I have assumed that the column descriptions for each table are the same as in the SQL code. If they are not, you will need to adjust the column names accordingly.
3. The `MINUS` operation in SQL is not directly available in PySpark. I have used the `subtract` method instead.
4. I have assumed that `n_ELT_ID_JOB_LOG` is a global variable that can be referenced. If not, you will need to provide the correct value.
5. The `p_ELT_ID_BATCH` and `DDWH01_DW.SEQ_TM_DESC` are also assumed to be global variables. If not, you will need to provide the correct value.
