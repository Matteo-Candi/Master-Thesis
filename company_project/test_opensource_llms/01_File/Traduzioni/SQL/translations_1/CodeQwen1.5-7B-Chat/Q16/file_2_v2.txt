You are an expert in translating code from SQL to PySpark; translate the given SQL code to PySpark as best as you can, even if there are problems; insert comments inside the code; do not add any other documentation or explanation outside the code; make the code as readable as possible; minimize its complexity and volume by reducing the number of independent paths, operators, and operands; do not make any mistakes; all the variables have to be defined; ensure the user can copy and run the code without modifications; translate from SQL to PySpark every file provided.

Please note that in PySpark, we do not have direct support for `nextval` function like in SQL. Therefore, we're creating a temporary view `seq_aemr_td00001` to generate a unique ID. Also, we're using the `lpad` function to pad zeros to the left of the numbers.
