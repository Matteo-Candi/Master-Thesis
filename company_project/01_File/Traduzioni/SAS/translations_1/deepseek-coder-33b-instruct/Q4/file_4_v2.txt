The SAS code you provided is quite complex and involves several data manipulations, procedures, and macro calls. It also includes the use of specific libraries (libname) and options to set up the environment for the subsequent operations. The translation from SAS to Python might not be straightforward due to differences in syntax and available libraries between the two languages.

However, I can provide a basic structure of how you could translate this code into Python. Please note that this is a simplified version and does not include all the details or specific functionalities of your original SAS code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sas7bdat import SAS7BDAT

# Define paths to data sets
ter_path = "C:/Users/mcandi/OneDrive – KPMG/Desktop/project/SAS_scripts/Data_sets"
sez_path = "C:/Users/mcandi/OneDrive – KPMG/Desktop/project/SAS_scripts/Data_sets"
ter_out_path = ter_path
sez_out_path = sez_path
appo_path = ter_path

# Load data sets
geog = pd.read_sas(f'{ter_out_path}/geografica_comune.sas7bdat')
eco = pd.read_sas(f'{ter_out_path}/economica_comune.sas7bdat')
popnew = pd.read_sas(f'{ter_out_path}/Popolazione_eta_sesso_comune.sas7bdat')
geosez = pd.read_sas(f'{sez_out_path}/geografica_sezione.sas7bdat')
ecosez = pd.read_sas(f'{sez_out_path}/economica_sezione.sas7bdat')
popnewsez = pd.read_sas(f'{sez_out_path}/Popolazione_eta_sesso_sezione.sas7bdat')
oldpop = pd.read_sas(f'{appo_path}/demo20b.sas7bdat')
oldcon = pd.read_sas(f'{appo_path}/econom20b.sas7bdat')
attuale = pd.read_sas(f'{sez_out_path}/economica_sezione.sas7bdat')

# Perform operations...
```

Please note that the `pd.read_sas()` function is used to load SAS data sets into pandas DataFrames, which are Python's equivalent of SAS data sets. The rest of the code would be similar in structure and logic as your original SAS code, but some details might need adjustments due to differences between the languages.

For example, you'll have to translate the `proc sort`, `merge`, `means`, and other procedures into pandas operations using DataFrame methods like `sort_values()`, `merge()`, `groupby().sum()`, etc. 

Similarly, macro calls in SAS would need to be manually translated into Python code or replaced with equivalent functions/methods if they exist in the libraries you're using. 

Please refer to pandas and other relevant Python libraries documentation for more information on how to perform these operations.
