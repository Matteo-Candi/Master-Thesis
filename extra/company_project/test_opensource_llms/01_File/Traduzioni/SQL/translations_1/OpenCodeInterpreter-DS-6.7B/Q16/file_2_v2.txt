### Response:
PySpark does not support SQL's INSERT INTO syntax directly. However, you can use the DataFrameWriter API to achieve similar functionality. Here is the equivalent PySpark code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

# Read data from source table
source_df = spark.read.table("ddwh00_sa.ts_aemi0004_us_aem")

# Apply filters
filtered_df = source_df.filter((source_df.company_id.isin(['JIC', 'FOR'])) & 
                               (source_df.frequency_id == 'M') & 
                               ((source_df.product_id.isin(['CEB0', 'CEE2', 'CEE3', 'CEF0', 'CEG0'])) & 
                               (source_df.activity_id == f"{source_df.activity_id:03d}")
                               ) & 
                               (source_df.attribute_id == '99'))

# Select and transform columns
selected_df = filtered_df.select(
    nextSeq("ddwh01_dw.seq_aemr_td00001") as "aemr_id_retail_history",
    (when(to_date(col("main1.postdate")) == to_date(col("main1.rdate")), "COMPANY DATA").otherwise("COMPANY REVISION")).alias("aemr_cd_scenario"),
    col("company_id").alias("aemr_cd_rep_company_code"),
    substring(col("product_id"), 1, 2).alias("aemr_cd_program_code"),
    substring(col("product_id"), 3, 2).alias("aemr_cd_prodruct_code"),
    col("chart_id").alias("aemr_cd_model_chart"),
    col("frequency_id").alias("aemr_cd_rep_frequency"),
    lpad(col("activity_id"), 3, "0").alias("aemr_cd_activity_code"),
    col("size_id").alias("aemr_cd_size_code"),
    lit(None).alias("aemr_cd_upper_size"),
    lit(None).alias("aemr_cd_lower_size"),
    col("main1.cd_year").alias("aemr_cd_year"),
    lpad(col("period"), 2, "0").alias("aemr_cd_month"),
    col("rdate").alias("aemr_dt_rdate"),
    col("main1.postdate").alias("aemr_dt_post_date"),
    substring(col("geography_id"), 1, 3).alias("aemr_cd_fips_country_code"),
    substring(col("geography_id"), 4, 3).alias("aemr_cd_fips_state_code"),
    substring(col("geography_id"), 7, 3).alias("aemr_cd_fips_county_code"),
    substring(col("geography_id"), 10, 3).alias("aemr_cd_fips_sub_county_code"),
    lpad(col("customer_type_id"), 3, "0").alias("aemr_cd_customer_type_code"),
    lpad(col("end_use_id"), 3, "0").alias("aemr_cd_end_use_code"),
    lit(None).alias("aemr_cd_attribute"),
    col("count_id").alias("aemr_qt_retail_qty"),

)

# Write to target table
selected_df.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("ddwh01_dw.td_aemr_retail_history")
```

Please note that PySpark does not support sequence generation in the same way SQL does (`ddwh01_dw.seq_aemr_td00001.nextval`). You may need to manage sequence generation manually or use other methods.

Also, please replace `nextSeq("ddwh01_dw.seq_aemr_td00001")` with the actual sequence generation method you are using.

This code assumes that the source table (`ddwh00_sa.ts_aemi0004_us_aem`) and target table (`ddwh01_dw.td_aemr_retail_history`) exist in your Spark environment. If they don't exist, you need to create them before running this code.
