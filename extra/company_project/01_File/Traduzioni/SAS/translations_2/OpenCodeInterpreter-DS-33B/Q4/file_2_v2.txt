This SAS macro is used to perform a complex operation over a group of data, specifically it's designed to round up or down values in a dataset based on the sum of another variable. The Python equivalent would involve reading and manipulating dataframes using pandas library, which has similar functionalities as SAS.

Here's how you could translate this code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def round_by_group(df, group_var, target_var, sum_var, output_file):
    # Sort the dataframe by the group variable
    df = df.sort_values(group_var)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the target variable for each group
    sums = df.groupby(group_var)[sum_var].sum().reset_index()
    
    # Merge the original dataframe with the calculated sums
    merged = pd.merge(df, sums, on=group_var)
    
    # Calculate the difference between the target variable and the sum
    merged['diff'] = merged[target_var] - merged[sum_var]
    
    # Sort the merged dataframe by the group variable in descending order
    merged = merged.sort_values([group_var, target_var], ascending=[True, False])
    
    # Create a new column 'segnale' to keep track of the position of each row within its group
    merged['segnale'] = merged.index + 1
    
    # Select only the first row from each group and keep only the 'segnale' column
    segnali = merged[merged.index == merged.groupby(group_var)['segnale'].idxmin()][['segnale']]
    
    # Merge the original dataframe with the 'segnale' values
    df = pd.merge(df, segnali, on=group_var)
    
    # Update the target variable based on the difference and the position within its group
    df[target_var] = df.apply(lambda row: max(row[target_var] - 1, 0) if row['diff'] < 0 else row[target_var], axis=1)
    
    # Drop unnecessary columns
    df = df.drop(['segnale', 'diff'], axis=1)
    
    # Write the result to an output file
    df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
```

This Python function does essentially the same thing as the SAS macro you provided: it rounds up or down values in a dataframe based on the sum of another variable for each group. It uses pandas library which is very powerful for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
