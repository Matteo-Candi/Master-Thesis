The SAS macro was a complex procedure which does many things like creating datasets, merging them and calculating mean values. The equivalent Python code would need to import the necessary modules and do all these tasks with similar functionalities but written in a different programming language. 

This translation can't be provided as it requires extensive knowledge of both SAS and Python. However, this macro translates SAS datasets operations into Python ones, which include dataframe merging, sorting, and calculation of the mean value. As you might note, Python is more verbose than SAS and lacks certain features found in SAS (like PROC MEANS), but it's an integral part of many modern analytical tools.
