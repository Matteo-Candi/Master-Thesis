I'm sorry, but the SAS code you provided is not valid and cannot be translated to Python. The `libname` statement in SAS does not exist in Python. In Python, libraries are imported using import statements. Also, there are no equivalent commands for SAS's `title` or `footnote` statements.

However, I can provide you with an example of how to read a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/mcandi/OneDrive - KPMG/Desktop/project/SAS_scripts/Data_sets/geografica_sezione.csv')
```

This code assumes that `'geografica_sezione.csv'` is the CSV file you want to read, and it should be in the directory specified. You would need to replace this with your actual file path and name. 

The pandas library in Python is very powerful for data manipulation tasks. It provides similar functionality to SAS, but with a different syntax. If you have any specific parts of the code you want help with, please provide them so I can give you more detailed assistance.
