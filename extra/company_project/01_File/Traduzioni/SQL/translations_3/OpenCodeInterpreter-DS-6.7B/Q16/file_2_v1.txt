### Instruction:
You are an expert in translating code from SQL to PySpark error-free, maintaining all functionality; the code is commented but not exaplined; do not use spark.sql() function and define properly columns; PySpark code is more efficient than SQL one while keeping it readable and concise.
Translate the following code from SQL to PySpark:

### Response:
Unfortunately, you cannot perform INSERT operations with PySpark the same way you would do in a traditional SQL environment. The PySpark DataFrame API provides a simple way to create new DataFrame by running SQL queries or by combining existing DataFrames. However, it does not support SQL's INSERT INTO command.

In PySpark, you can achieve data transformation and manipulation functionality similar to what you have in your SQL query, with Spark SQL and DataFrame API. We can convert the SQL query into equivalent PySpark code using DataFrame transformations and actions which can be much readable and efficient than running a raw SQL query. Here's how we could translate your SQL query into PySpark:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, to_date, split, monotonically_increasing_id, when, lpad, substr
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# assuming spark is your SparkSession instance
df = spark.read.format("jdbc").options(
    url="jdbc:postgresql:host=hostname;port=5432;database=database;user=username;password=password",
    dbtable="ddwh00_sa.ts_aemi0004_us_aem").load()

df = df.filter((df.company_id.isin(['JIC', 'FOR'])) & (df.frequency_id == 'M'))

df = df.withColumn("aemr_id_retail_history", monotonically_increasing_id())
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_scenario", 
                   when(to_date(df.postdate).year == to_date(df.rdate).year, "COMPANY DATA")
                   .otherwise("COMPANY REVISION"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_rep_company_code", df.company_id)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_program_code", substr(df.product_id, 1, 2))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_prodruct_code", substr(df.product_id, 3, 2))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_model_chart", df.chart_id)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_rep_frequency", df.frequency_id )
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_activity_code", lpad(df.activity_id, 3, "0"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_size_code", df.size_id)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_year", df.cd_year)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_month", lpad(df.period, 2, "0"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_dt_rdate", df.rdate)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_dt_post_date", df.postdate)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_fips_country_code", substr(df.geography_id, 1, 3))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_fips_state_code", substr(df.geography_id, 4, 3))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_fips_county_code", substr(df.geography_id, 7, 3))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_fips_sub_county_code", substr(df.geography_id, 10, 3))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_customer_type_code", lpad(df.customer_type_id, 3, "0"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_end_use_code", lpad(df.end_use_id, 3, "0"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_qt_retail_qty", df.count_id)
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_source_system", lit("US AEM"))
df = df.withColumn("aemr_id_batch_id", lit(1)) 
df = df.withColumn("aemr_cd_model_id", df.chart_id)

df.write.format("jdbc").options(
    url="jdbc:postgresql:host=hostname;port=5432;database=database;user=username;password=password",
    dbtable="ddwh01_dw.td_aemr_retail_history",
    driver="com.postgresql.jdbc.Driver").save()
```

Please note that you would need to replace some parts with values according to your environment like "hostname", "database", "username", "password".

In the above code, I am:

1) Read a table from a PostgreSQL database.
2) Filtered rows based on provided conditions.
3) Defined new columns based on your original SQL query using PySpark's column and dataframe transformations.
4) Write the transformed DataFrame back into a PostgreSQL Database.
